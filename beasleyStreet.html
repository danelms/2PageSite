    <div class="main">
        <p>I’m ankle deep in human waste<br>
            The toilet has been clogged<br>
            Marrowbone jelly all over the place<br>
            I don’t even have a dog<br>
            The man upstairs he grabs my arm<br>
            Saying don’t I know your dad<br>
            All I could hear were the fire alarms<br>
            The day my pad went mad<br>
            <br>
            All I could hear were the fire alarms<br>
            The day my pad went mad<br>
            <br>
            The kitchen has been ransacked<br>
            Ski trails in the hall<br>
            A chicken has been dhansaked<br>
            And thrown against the wall<br>
            In walks this dumb waiter<br>
            With a fountain pen and pad<br>
            Saying how do you want this alligator<br>
            The day my pad went mad<br>
            <br>
            Saying how do you want this alligator<br>
            The day my pad went mad<br>
            <br>
            The hamster had been slaugtered<br>
            The parrot bound and gagged<br>
            The guard dog had been sorted out<br>
            And absolutely shagged<br>
            The goldfish drowned, the cat was found<br>
            Kicked around and stabbed<br>
            The radio did not make a sound<br>
            The day my pad went mad<br>
            <br>
            The radio did not make a sound<br>
            The day my pad went mad<br>
            <br>
            The pop-up toaster refused to pop<br>
            The chandelier was smashed<br>
            The starter motor would not stop<br>
            The tyres had been slashed<br>
            There was no way out of there<br>
            I was stuck with what I had<br>
            Out of order, beyond repair<br>
            The day my pad went mad<br>
            <br>
            Out of order, beyond repair<br>
            The day my pad went mad<br>
            <br>
            Yesterday I had the place rewired<br>
            And slung out all of my junk<br>
            A tumble dryer and a two bar fire<br>
            And a telephone now defunct<br>
            I peeped through the venetian blinds<br>
            And the rain fell down so sad<br>
            On the broken home I left behind<br>
            The day my pad went mad<br>
            <br>
            On the broken home I left behind<br>
            The day my pad went mad</p>
